# NBA 2K26 SuperHooper
### Created by: Christian Blunt
### The AI agent is designed to take live game input from a console, process it, make decisions, and control the game automatically. This involves several integrated components:
1. **Frame Capture**: Captures input frames from NBA 2K25 running on Console.
2. **Object Detection**: Uses computer vision techniques to create bounding boxes for relevant in-game objects (players, ball, hoop, etc.).
3. **Decision-Making Neural Network**: Processes bounding box coordinates and other extracted data to predict optimal game actions.
4. **Controller Integration**: Sends the predicted actions to the Console through a virtual controller interface.
5. **Autonomous Gameplay**: The agent plays NBA 2K25 in real-time without human intervention.
